Paste the following into a Jupyter terminal to clone it.

git clone https://github.com/MattBartie/Lab-Exercises-Harry-and-Matty.git

Once you have tthe software, you can run the main cell in jupyter to run the program. It will ask you for a name that you just type in, and then for an age that you type in as well. From there it wil print out the results.

### Why we chose the license we did

We wanted a license that was very open and not restrictive. The MIT license was striaght foward and seemed to align with the openess and free use that we wanted.
